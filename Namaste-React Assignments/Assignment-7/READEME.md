# What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples

    1. Importing images directly in the component.
        import logo from './logo.png'; // path to the image
    2. From a different folder.
        <img src="path"/>
    3. Providing the url in css.
        background-image: url('path/to/image.png');

# console.log(usestate())

    this will return us the initial value of the state variable and the updater function for that variable.

# If no dependency array in useeffect()

    It will be called each time the component renders.

# SPA

    SPA sands for single page application, React is a single page application as we don't have to reload different pages but can just render different components on the same page.

# Client Side Routing vs server Side Routing

    In client side routing no network calls are made where as in server side routing network call will go and fetch the data.
