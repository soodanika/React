# Microservice

    It is an architectural style in which application is a bundle of small services that are deployed independently and each service performs a specific function and they can comunicate with each other using protocols like https.

# Monolith

    It is an architectural style where the whole application is developed as a single unified codebase.

# Monolith vs Microservice

    Monolith - single codebase, tightly coupled, long deployment cycles.

    Microservice - independent codebases, loosely coupled, faster deployment cycles.

# useEffect Hook

    It is used to perform side effects in functional components such as fetching data, DOM manipulation etc.

# Optional Chaining

    It is a feature in JS that provides a easy way to access properties on objects when the object might be null or undefined. It helps in such a way that it doesnt throw an error but returns undefined.

# Shimmer UI

    It resembles the UI of the page till the actual data loads.

# JS Expression vs JS Statement

    An expression is a piece of code that produces a value.

    A statement is a line of code that performs an action.

# Conditional Rendering

    Rendering a component based on some condition.

# CORS

    CORS stands for cross origin resource sharing.
    We can access anything in the same domain but when we have to access anything from a different domain then we might get a CORS error.
    First before sending the actual request a PREFLIGHT request is sent along with the origin and method, once the prefilight is successful the actual request is sent.

# async and await

    Async - it is used to define a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function returns a promise that will either resolve to a value or reject with an error.
    Await - It is used inside async function to pause the execution of that function until the promise is resolved.

# const json = await data.json();

    await is used to wait till the promise is resolved and .json() is used to extract and parse the data as json data from the Readable stream returned by the promise.
