# Configuring tailwaind

    we need to download tailwind and postcss from npm, and configure both postcss and tailwaind to use it.

# In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins)?

    theme customizes default styles, extend adds or overrides classes, plugins adds custom functionality, and content configures scanned files for classes.

# .postcssrc file?

    It is used for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
